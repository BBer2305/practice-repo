# Git-Intro

This repository is meant to let people learn how Git and GitHub work, without messing with any projects. Feel free to change files (aside from this README) and upload new ones.

Check out our [Git tutorial](https://github.com/UFOSC/tutorials/blob/master/git/Step-by-step.md) for any help.
